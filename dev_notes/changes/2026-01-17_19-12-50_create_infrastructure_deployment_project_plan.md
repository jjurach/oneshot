# Change: Create Infrastructure Deployment Project Plan

## Related Project Plan
Oneshot Infrastructure Deployment

## Overview
Created a comprehensive project plan for establishing AWS ECS infrastructure using Terraform to enable production-ready deployment of the Oneshot asynchronous task orchestration system. This plan follows the completion of core asynchronous refactoring and planned UI/persistence enhancements.

## Files Modified
- `dev_notes/project_plans/2026-01-17_19-12-41_oneshot_infrastructure_deployment.md`: Created new project plan document outlining infrastructure setup, containerization, CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment strategy.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Planning phase only - no code or infrastructure changes implemented
- **Risk**: Low - this is documentation of future work
- **Dependencies**: Builds on existing asynchronous refactor, UI integration, and persistence backend plans
- **Next Steps**: Await approval before proceeding with infrastructure implementation
