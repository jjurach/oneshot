# Change: Commit Project Plan for Documentation Files

**Related Project Plan**  
dev_notes/project_plans/2026-01-17_18-45-56_commit_uncommitted_documentation_files.md

**Overview**  
Committed the uncommitted project plan file that outlines the steps for committing documentation files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .gitignore). The plan was created but not previously committed, so this change adds it to version control.

**Files Modified**  
- `dev_notes/project_plans/2026-01-17_18-45-56_commit_uncommitted_documentation_files.md`: Added to repository (new file, 21 lines).

**Impact Assessment**  
- Low impact: Adds documentation to the repository. No functional code changes. Improves project documentation completeness by including the plan that was executed.
