## Overview
Created comprehensive research project plan to investigate cline's streaming capabilities, buffering behavior, and file-based activity monitoring. The plan includes detailed experimental framework for optimizing activity monitoring/detection and implementation roadmap for --output-format json support.

## Files Modified
- `dev_notes/project_plans/2026-01-17_23-16-01_cline_streaming_research_and_experiments.md`: New research project plan with detailed phases covering cline capability research, buffering analysis, file monitoring investigation, experimental framework development, and activity monitoring optimization experiments.

## Impact Assessment
- No code changes - pure research and planning phase
- Establishes foundation for future streaming and monitoring optimizations
- Provides structured approach to experimental validation of performance improvements
- Creates roadmap for implementing JSON output format and real-time activity detection
- Sets clear success criteria and risk mitigation strategies for research phase
