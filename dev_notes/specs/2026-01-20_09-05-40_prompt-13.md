Consider these demo scripts:
- `ls *demo*py` and `ls *demo*sh`
- move them to new examples/ directory
  - make them more consistent -- if they serve a similar purpose, then give them similar names and usage
- update any references in README.md or docs/ which describe these demo scripts
- run each demo script to verify working
