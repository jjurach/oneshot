I suspect oneshot is not generating a stream of "oneshot activity" events from
the direct executor.

This can be achieved by having the executor create a javascript object on LLM
ingres and egres, which emulates other json activity -- which records the
prompt sent to the model, and then all information about the model execution
when the response is returned afterwards.  In other words:
the direct executor will be generating its own json activity events instead of
receiving them from an executing agent.

Ensure this direct javascript object gets correctly wrapped with a timestamp,
"executor" attribute, and other metadata, and converted to json text in the
$id-oneshot-log.json file.

Ensure that the auditor prompt generation for direct executor is able to work
with this $id-oneshot-log.json NDJSON activity.

Once you have analyzed the source code and feel confident about the solution,
create the project plan (as described in AGENTS.md) with detailed checklist
tasks of each change that probably needs to be made and probably needs to be
tested. Include filenames and code samples to demonstrate aspects of this
solution.

Only create the plan.  Do not implement it.
