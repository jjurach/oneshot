Cleanup documentation

For each of the following executors: cline, claude, aider, gemini, create the
following checklist items in this next project plan:

- scan the docs/ for any reference to this executor
  - does this executor appear in a list with other executors?
    - is this list complete -- are ALL the executors mentioned in this list?
  - does each mention of this executor make sense in the current implementation?
  - update any documentation for this executor.  reduce repetition. delete superfluous documents.

- consider the special "direct" executor. ensure it is documented and
  represented in any comprehensive list of all executors.

Review demo script(s)
- Run each demo script at least once and for executor if the script take executor as an option 
- fix and re-test with any obvious problems

Review README.md
- update with any instructions for new demo scripts or changes to existing demo scripts.
