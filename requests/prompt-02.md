Role: Senior Software Architect & Systems Planner Project: oneshot (Worker-Auditor Autonomous Loop) Objective: Design and implement a robust integration for three high-performance Autonomous Executor Providers: Aider, Roo Code, and Gemini CLI.

Task Overview: You are to architect a "CLI-first" provider strategy that allows oneshot to delegate tasks to these agents in a fully headless, non-interactive manner. Each agent must serve as the Worker that produces a verifiable change-set for the Auditor.

Provider-Specific Implementation Logic:

AiderExecutor:

Command: aider --message "{task}" --yes-test --no-stream

This command was tested and is understood to work well for our purposes:
```
aider --message "What is the capital of france?" --chat-mode ask --yes-always --no-stream --no-pretty
```
given these preferred settings.  Incorporate these configurations into command line parameters and configuration file inputs to support these features.  Consider avoiding env vars and passing these configurations directly to the aider process as its cli parameters.
```
AIDER_MODEL=ollama_chat/llama-pro
AIDER_EDITOR_MODEL=ollama_chat/llama-pro
AIDER_ARCHITECT=true
AIDER_EDIT_FORMAT=whole
OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434
```

Requirement: Capture the automatic git commit hash generated by Aider and include it in the ExecutionResult.

Cleanup: Ensure .aider.chat.history.md does not pollute the user's project root unnecessarily.

GeminiCLIExecutor:

Command: gemini --prompt "{task}" --yolo

Requirement: Utilize the "YOLO" auto-approval mode for uninterrupted terminal operations.

Logging: Gemini CLI produces verbose "thought" logs; implement a filter to prioritize the "Action" and "Observation" steps for the Auditor's review.

Architectural Standards:

Inheritance: All classes must inherit from oneshot.providers.base.BaseExecutor.

Subprocess Handling: Implement a shared _run_command utility that handles STDOUT/STDERR merging and strips ANSI color codes to ensure the Auditor receives clean text.

Security: Map environment-specific API keys (AIDER_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY) safely into the subprocess environment without leaking them to logs.

Deliverable: > Provide the full Python implementation for these three providers, ensuring they follow the project's existing type-hinting and error-handling conventions. Include a brief summary of how the Auditor should interpret the success/failure of each specific tool.
